# Questions
1. Understand different types of software testing and their significance.
2. Differentiate between functional and non-functional testing.
3. Learn the key differences between unit testing and integration testing.
4. Explore system and acceptance testing and their role in software quality.
5. Identify common types of non-functional testing and their importance.

# Answers:
1a. Functional testing focuses on verifying that the software functions according to specified requirements

1b. Non-functional testing evaluates aspects of the software that do not relate directly to specific behaviors or functions

1c. **Manual Testing:** Testers execute test cases manually without using automation tools. This approach is often used for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing.

1d. **Automated Testing:** Test scripts are written and executed using automation tools, allowing for faster execution of repetitive tests and greater coverage.

1e. **Regression Testing:** Conducted after changes to ensure that existing functionality remains unaffected.

1f. **Retesting:** Involves executing specific test cases that failed in previous tests after defects have been fixed, ensuring those specific issues are resolved.

2. Functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies that each function of the software application operates in conformance with the required specification while Non-functional testing evaluates aspects of the software that do not relate directly to specific behaviors or functions. It focuses on how well the system performs under various conditions, including performance, usability, security, and compatibility.

3a. **Unit Testing:** Tests individual components or functions for correct behavior.

3b. **Integration Testing:**	Ensures that combined components work together correctly.

4a. **System Testing:**	Validates the complete system against specified requirements.

4b. **Acceptance Testing:**	Conducted to determine if the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment.

5a. **Performance Testing:**	Assesses how the application performs under various conditions.

5b. **Security Testing:**	Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.

5c. **Usability Testing:**	Evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the application is.

5d. **Compatibility Testing:**	Ensures that the software works across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
